		Wise men say<br>
		Only fools rush in<br>
		But I can't help falling in love with you<br>
		Shall I stay?<br>
		Would it be a sin<br>
		If I can't help falling in love with you?<br>
		Like a river flows<br>
		Surely to the sea<br>
		Darling, so it goes<br>
		Some things are meant to be<br>
		Take my hand<br>
		Take my whole life too<br>
		For I can't help falling in love with you<br>
		Like a river flows<br>
		Surely to the sea<br>
		Darling, so it goes<br>
		Some things are meant to be<br>
		Take my hand<br>
		Take my whole life too<br>
		For I can't help falling in love with you<br>
		For I can't help falling in love with you<br>

		It's now or never<br>
		Come hold me tight<br>
		Kiss me my darling<br>
		Be mine tonight<br>
		Tomorrow will be too late<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		My love won't wait<br>
		When I first saw you<br>
		With your smile so tender<br>
		My heart was captured<br>
		My soul surrendered<br>
		I'd spend a lifetime<br>
		Waiting for the right time<br>
		Now that you're near<br>
		The time is here at last<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		Come hold me tight<br>
		Kiss me my darling<br>
		Be mine tonight<br>
		Tomorrow will be too late<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		My love won't wait<br>
		Just like a willow<br>
		We would cry an ocean<br>
		If we lost true love<br>
		And sweet devotion<br>
		Your lips excite me<br>
		Let your arms invite me<br>
		For who knows when<br>
		We'll meet again this way<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		Come hold me tight<br>
		Kiss me my darling<br>
		Be mine tonight<br>
		Tomorrow will be too late<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		My love won't wait<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		My love won't wait<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		My love won't wait<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		My love won't wait<br>
